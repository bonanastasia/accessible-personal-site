## Project Overview

Our team developed an inclusive smart home solution that makes home automation accessible to everyone, with a special focus on users with visual impairments. The system uses advanced speech recognition and natural language processing to provide intuitive voice control, while incorporating haptic feedback for tactile confirmation of actions.

## Technical Challenges

One of the biggest challenges was creating a reliable voice recognition system that could work effectively in noisy environments and understand diverse speech patterns, including users with speech impediments. We solved this by implementing a custom machine learning model trained on a diverse dataset of voices and ambient conditions.
