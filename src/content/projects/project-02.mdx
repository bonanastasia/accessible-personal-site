description: Since Mike Miles was appointed as HISD superintendent in June 2023, there has been widespread principal turnover across the district. The Houston Chronicle tracked the leadership changes at HISD campuses through a series of public records requests submitted to the district since summer 2023.
responsibilities: I source, compiled, and analysed data from disparate HISD systems to track removals, reassignments, and resignations.
